# Scan My Notes

The goal of Scan My Notes is to convert a photo of handwritten text into typed text. For word recognition, we used the model proposed in https://github.com/githubharald/SimpleHTR. For text segmentation, we used the following repo https://github.com/arthurflor23/text-segmentation. 

We serve the application using Nginx, uWSGI and Flask. The Android app is used to take photo and send HTTP request to the server.
